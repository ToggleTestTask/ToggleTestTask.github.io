            <p class="pb-3">
                A large proportion of crimes in the NTCA are not reported to the authorities in the first place, especially those committed by organised criminal gangs or against groups that have historically been victims of state-sponsored violence, such as indigenous communities and LGBT+ people. There is a perception that reporting these crimes will not result in appropriate protection or justice, and may even put the victim in greater danger from reprisals if the perpetrators discover that the victim has gone to the police.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-3">
                Even when crimes are reported and the state is willing to act, there are still significant challenges that foster impunity. Justice systems are overburdened and under-resourced, and lack mechanisms to protect plaintiffs and witnesses from violent retribution while they await their case to pass through the backlogged system.
