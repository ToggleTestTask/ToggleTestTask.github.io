            <h4>‘Iron fist’ tactics in El Salvador have led to more displacement</h4>  <div class="underline wow slideInLeft animated" style="visibility: visible;"></div>
            <p class="pb-3">
                Since the mid-2000s, state security forces in El Salvador have adopted a highly repressive ‘iron fist’ approach to combat the high levels of gang violence in the country. However, these violent and often indiscriminate tactics have actually increased levels of violence in some communities, and therefore increased displacement. The aggressive response, mostly focused in urban neighbourhoods in the capital San Salvador, has pushed gangs to become even more extreme, expanding their territory into rural areas and targeting ever younger recruits. This has increased the insecurity of rural communities, and youth in particular, leading to an increase in displacement as more people flee the violence and forced recruitment.
                The repressive measures have also increased animosity between gangs and state security forces. By way of revenge, gangs target police and military officers and their families, pushing them into displacement as they flee direct threats from criminal groups.
            </br>There have also been serious concerns about the state’s abuse of power, its arbitrary harassment of young people, disappearances and extrajudicial executions in the name of fighting gang violence. State agents have been known to harass anyone who falls into the stereotype of a ‘gang member’, targeting young men on the basis of their footwear, hairstyle, tattoos, or simply because they are out together after dark. They may be detained without reason, or beaten and tortured to extract information. This has resulted in an increase in displacement of young people from gang-affected areas, who are not fleeing criminal violence but harassment and abuse from state security forces.
