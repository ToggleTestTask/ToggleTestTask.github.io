            <h1>The particular vulnerability of indigenous communities</h1>
            <p class="pb-3">
                Indigenous populations across the NTCA, especially in Guatemala, are marginalised, live in poverty and are excluded from accessing education, formal work and public services because of language barriers and discrimination. This makes indigenous people especially vulnerable to displacement when faced with violence and threats, as they lack the resources to protect themselves, and are less likely to seek and obtain support and protection from the state. In addition, indigenous communities are especially at risk of forced evictions by the state, since they tend to inhabit land that is identified for megaprojects or nature reserves.
                Indigenous populations also suffer particular challenges that make them prone to multiple displacements and further marginalisation. If forced to flee their land and community, which are often their main sources of income and support, they are unlikely to secure other employment, given their relative lack of education, language barriers and discrimination against them. This exacerbates their economic hardship, leading to further displacement as they move around seeking economic opportunities. Moreover, leaving their homes and land also means a loss of social networks and identity which indigenous groups find particularly difficult to rebuild, leaving them increasingly vulnerable.
